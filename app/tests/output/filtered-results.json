      "content": "This is, they did behind us. [69] While there is some considerable doubt about it, I have not been satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Mr [HD] and Ms [TW] knew about the romantic relationship between their daughter and Ms [TW] prior to these Court proceedings. The obvious point is that it is highly unlikely they would have transferred money to Ms [SD] as frequently and as freely as they did, had they known about the relationship or even the remotest possibility or concern that there could be a relationship property claim against Ms [SD]. 101 NOE, page 241, line 30. 102 NOE, page 268, line 16. 24 [70] Ms [SD] acquired a 2010 Lexus car in December 2019, soon after she started her full-time job in [town A], which car was funded by money Ms [LZ] transferred to her own ANZ account from China, and which funds Ms [SD] was then able to access. [71] On 20 September 2019 Ms [LZ] deposited $30,000 in her ANZ Go account (suffix 00). 103 On 25 September 2019 Ms [SD] transferred $25,000 from the Go account to Ms [LZ]’s 50 “Serious Saver” account. 104 From Ms [LZ]’s 50 account three payments were made to “Autoterminal” for the Lexus car: • 8 October 2019 $8,500 105 • 2 December 2019 $6,799 106 • 2 December 2019 $10,000 107 $25,299 [72] As I mentioned, Ms [TW] returned to China in early [2020] to visit her family, and then got stuck there due to the COVID lockdown and border closure. [73] It was on 19 April 2020 that Ms [SD] advised Ms [TW] via a WeChat message that she had cheated on her with another woman who was a colleague. The screenshots of the messages which Ms [SD] attached to her first affidavit as Annexure “A” run to nine pages and are unequivocal. They include the following exchanges: 108 Ms [SD]: I am sorry, but I don’t want to cheat you, I cheated on you, did what I was most ashamed of. Ms [TW]: So you’re breaking up with me? ... Ms [SD]: Let’s break up. I know it’s cruel to tell you at this point. Ms [TW]: And who? Ms [SD]: Colleague. Ms [TW]: You’re getting together? 103 BOD, page 1215. 104 BOD, page 1216 and NOE, page 98, line 1. 105 BOD, page 1245. 106 BOD, page 1243. 107 Ibid. 108 BOD, page 520 to 528. 25 Ms [SD]: not necessarily. Ms [SD]: But I think it’s better to break up with you. ... Ms [TW]: When did this happen? Ms [SD]: These two days. Ms [TW]: Indian colleague? ... Ms [SD]: Yes. Ms [SD]: Also a roommate. Ms [TW]: Okay. ... Ms [TW]: So you’re gonna stay with her for a while? Ms [SD]: Yes. Ms [SD]: But I want to go out for a while before I decide. [74] Ms [TW]’s affidavit evidence was that the relationship “deteriorated” in mid- April 2020 when Ms [SD] told her about the affair, 109 but she said that they remained in contact and continued to have long phone conversations. She deposed that the parties separated on 5 August 2020 when Ms [SD] informed her she had unilaterally withdrawn their joint residence visa application in July. 110 [75] I do not accept that the parties continued to be in a relationship after Ms [SD] informed Ms [TW] of her affair on 19 April. Ms [TW] has not provided evidence of regular or amicable communication, let alone any declarations of love or forgiveness after 19 April and I am influenced in my conclusion by the affidavit evidence of the parties’ mutual friend, [YK], who was not required for cross-examination. 109 BOD, page 373 at [43]. 110 At [44]. 26 [76] Ms [YK] deposed that while communicating with Ms [TW] via WeChat in July 2020, Ms [TW] said that she had split up with Ms [SD] in April. 111 Ms [YK] provided an English translation from a translation service of the WeChat message where Ms [TW] said, “I haven’t told you that I actually broke up with her in April. ” Ms [TW]’s follow-up message, sent the same day, 18 July 2020, said “Might as well tell you today, [you] will find out anyway”. 112 [77] Accordingly, and as noted earlier, I find that the date of separation was 19 April 2020 as stated by Ms [SD], and not 5 August 2020 as argued by Ms [TW]. [78] Ms [TW] was able to return to Christchurch [in 2020]. 113 At that stage she was still completing her [education details deleted]. Ms [TW] acknowledged that she obtained an internship in [2021] 114 and has been working full-time since she graduated in [2021]. [79] Ms [TW] lived at the [address 1] property from [mid-2020] until [mid-2021]. She said that she moved out of [address 1] as soon as she secured full-time employment. 115 However, it was not until 6 October 2021 that her (former) solicitor advised Ms Park by email that Ms [TW] had moved out of the [address 1] property. 116 [80] Ms [TW] has also acknowledged that she received and used rental of $5,760 from tenants in the home between August and December 2020. 117 Ms [TW] said in her oral evidence that three bedrooms were still rented out when she returned to New Zealand [in mid-2020]. 118 Gradually the tenants all moved out and it was just Ms [TW] in the house as from [early 2021]. 119 111 BOD, page 1298 at [8]. 112 BOD, page 1350. 113 NOE, page 110, line 1. 114 NOE, page 109, line 25. 115 NOE, page 110, lines 7 to 9. 116 BOD, page 417. 117 BOD, page 311 at [6(a)]. 118 NOE, page 110, line 21. 119 NOE, page 111, lines 27 to 30. 27 [81] Ms [TW]’s evidence was that she was not able to sign tenancy agreements as the landlord to rent rooms to new tenants because the house was registered in Ms [SD]’s name and Ms [SD] did not agree to Ms [TW] arranging further tenants. 120 [82] Ms [SD] confirmed that [address 1] has been rented again as from 19 April 2022 and has been managed since then by a rental management company, Rempstone. 121 Ms [SD] advised that the house is now rented to one tenant for $970 per week. 122 [83] It is agreed that Ms [SD] paid $7,500 to Ms [TW] on 1 September 2020, being one half of the $15,000 that Ms [SD] had withdrawn from the joint 02 account on 20 July 2020. 123 The respective ANZ joint account balances at the date of separation (19 April 2020) were $6,088. 98 124 and $9,611. 37, 125 so $15,700 in total. That being the case, and as conceded by Ms [TW] she is required to account for the $4,000 that she withdrew from the joint 02 account on 13 July 2020 126 to fund her airfares from China to New Zealand. [84] The most recent developments are that Ms [SD] moved from [town A] to [town B] in April 2022 127 to take up a new job as a [job title deleted]. Ms [SD] was made redundant from that position only a couple of weeks before the hearing, on 17 April 2024, 128 and does not yet have new employment. [85] Ms [SD] purchased a three-bedroom house in [town B] in [2023] for $800,000 with significant assistance from her parents who gifted her half the purchase price. The balance was borrowed from the bank. The house is registered in Ms [SD]’s sole name. 129 120 BOD, page 14, at [73]. 121 NOE, page 203, line 7. 122 NOE, page 119, lines 12 to 26. 123 BOD, page 23. 124 BOD, page 601. 125 BOD, page 643. 126 BOD, page 23. 127 NOE, page 229, line 5. 128 NOE, page 115, line 31. 129 NOE, page 229, line 29, to page 230, line 17. 28 [86] Ms [SD] now has permanent residency in New Zealand. 130 Ms [TW] is not yet a permanent resident but has a residency visa. She advised that she will receive permanent residency in 12 months’ time. 131 [87] Having set out the background in some detail, I turn now to the particular legal issues and decisions on those issues. Is the [address 1] property held on resulting trust? [88] For Mr [HD] and Ms [LZ] it is pleaded that the [address 1] property is held for them (by Ms [SD]) on resulting trust. [89] As noted by the Court of Appeal in Chang v Lee 132 the principle of resulting trust was explained by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in the House of Lords in Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Burrough Council 133 and arises in circumstances where: “ ... A makes a voluntary payment to B or pays (wholly or in part) for the purchase of a property which is vested in either B alone or in the joint names of A and B, there is a presumption that A did not intend to make a gift to B; the money or property is held on trust for A (if he is the sole provider of the money) or in the case of the joint purchase by A and B in shares proportionate to their contribution. It is important to stress that this is only a presumption, which presumption can be easily rebutted either by the counter- presumption of advancement or by direct evidence of A's intention to make an outright transfer ... ” [90] Lord Browne-Wilkinson went on to state that: “ ... resulting trust[s] are traditionally regarded as examples of trusts giving effect to the common intention of the parties. A resulting trust is not imposed by law against the intentions of the trustee (as is a constructive trust) but gives effect to his presumed intention. ..."

      "content": "[48] “Rights of custody” is defined in s 97 of the Act as follows: 97 Rights of custody defined For the purposes of this subpart, rights of custody, in relation to a child, include the following rights attributed to a person, institution, or other body, either jointly or alone, under the law of the Contracting State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the child’s removal or retention: (a) rights relating to the care of the person of the child (for example, the role of providing day-to-day care for the child); and (b) in particular, the right to determine the child’s place of residence. [49] “Rights of access” are separately defined in the interpretation section, which is s 95: rights of access include— (a) the right to visit a child (for example, under an order for contact made under this Act); and (b) the right to take a child for a limited period of time to a place other than the child’s habitual residence (for example, under an order for contact made under this Act) 14 [50] It is clear that [Mr Barclay] had been having “access” with [Felix] in Ireland, in the traditional sense of that term, and ever since the parties separated. At times he had substantial access, for several days (and nights) at a time, and particularly in school holidays and on occasions that [Ms Carran] was away from Ireland herself. [51] In my view it is semantics whether the time that [Mr Barclay] had with [Felix] in Ireland is described as “access”, “contact”, “care”, “day-to-day care” or “shared care”. It cannot be disputed that [Ms Carran] has always been [Felix]’s primary caregiver, but nor can it be disputed that [Mr Barclay] had significant periods of [Felix]’s care himself. Even two nights per fortnight, as [Ms Carran] has deposed the arrangement was from 2021, is a form of shared care, or at least it would be regarded as shared care, or a form of shared care, in New Zealand. [52] It is also clear, however, that neither party ever sought a custody or access order from the Irish District Court, and nor was [Mr Barclay] appointed as a legal guardian of [Felix] prior to [Felix]’s removal from Ireland in November 2022. [53] As at November 2022 [Ms Carran] was [Felix]’s only legal guardian, and therefore she had the sole right to determine [Felix]’s place of residence. Whilst that is an unfortunate outcome/reality for [Mr Barclay], it is not in dispute. [54] On [Mr Barclay]’s behalf the submission has been made, which I accept, that [Mr Barclay] could have applied for a Court order at any point, but didn’t because he didn’t need to, given that [Mr Barclay] and [Ms Carran] were able to agree about access arrangements. New Zealand case law [55] Mr Fogarty referred me to a line of cases where New Zealand courts have found that fathers who were not legal guardians, or who did not have a Court order in their favour, have nonetheless been found to have “rights of custody”. 15 [56] Dellabarca v Christie is one such case with not dissimilar facts. 48 Ms Christie took her two-year-old son Antony from New Zealand to Western Australia in November 1995, and Mr Dellabarca sought an order for return under the Hague Convention. Mr Dellabarca was not a legal guardian and did not have a court order, but after the parties separated and prior to the removal to Australia the parties had attended counselling together and reached an “agreement” about Mr Dellabarca’s weekly access with Antony which the counsellor then recorded in a document. [57] Ultimately, the Court of Appeal found that the document prepared by the counsellor was not an agreement having legal effect, as required by article 3 of the Convention. 49 Indeed, the Court of Appeal found that the counsellor’s document/report did not amount to an agreement at all because, inter alia, it was not in the form of an agreement, it was not signed by the parties, and was imprecise in its terms. 50 [58] Nonetheless, the Court of Appeal clarified that the term “rights of custody” does not have to be read as requiring that the claimants in question have the right to determine the child’s right of residence: 51 Rather, it can be read in this alternative way: claimants may succeed if they show that they have any qualifying rights relating to the care of the person or the child, one of which rights may be the right to determine place of residence. That particular right, on this reading, is just one of the qualifying rights of custody, or, to adapt a common expression, the existence of that right is sufficient but not necessary. [59] The Court of Appeal found that the removal of the child to Australia was in breach of Mr Dellabarca’s rights of custody, assuming that he had rights arising “by reason of an agreement having legal effect under the law of New Zealand”. 52 Mr Dellabarca’s claim failed at that last hurdle, given the finding already mentioned that the counsellor’s document was not an agreement having legal effect. 48 Dellabarca v Christie [1999] 2 NZLR 549 (CA). 49 Article 3 states that rights of custody may arise by operation of law or by reason of a judicial or administrative decision, or by reason of an agreement having legal effect under the law of that State. 50 At page 556. 51 Page 552. 52 Page 555. 16 [60] M v H [Custody] is another case where the parties were not living together when the child was born. 53 The parties had separated in the early stages of the mother’s pregnancy but after the birth the father had regular contact with his son for the next four years and 10 months until the mother unilaterally removed him to London. The English Court sought a declaration from the New Zealand Court confirming whether the removal from New Zealand was wrongful within the meaning of the Hague Convention. [61] The central issue on appeal to the High Court was whether Mr H was exercising “rights of custody” at the date of the removal. In the Family Court Judge Costigan had rejected the contention that because an agreement was oral it did not have legal effect. The High Court referred to the Court of Appeal decisions in Gross v Boda 54 and Dellabarca v Christie and upheld Judge Costigan’s finding: 55 We agree with both the conclusion, and reasoning of the Family Court Judge. Section 18 of the Guardianship Act does not require that agreements providing for the care of children must be in written form, although that is unquestionably a prudent safeguard. We think it would be wrong to hold that the significant number of parents who through the exercise of judgment and common sense agree about care arrangements on an informal oral basis do not thereby conclude an agreement in terms of s 18. Provided there is proper evidence to establish the nature of such arrangements, and evidence to show that the relevant rights of custody were being exercised at the time of removal, then we agree that the existence of an agreement having legal effect is made out. [62] The High Court went on to say: 56 The present is a good example of a case in which the informal rights of the father could have been perfected. However, there was no need for him to seek to do so, until too late. By then X had been wrongfully removed. [63] That is exactly the argument that Mr Fogarty has made in this case for [Mr Barclay]. 53 M v H [Custody] [2006] NZFLR 623. 54 Gross v Boda [1995] NZFLR 49 (CA). 55 At [30]. 56 At [32]. 17 [64] Fairfax v Ireton is another case where the Court of Appeal found that a written and signed parenting plan was an agreement “having legal effect” under New Zealand law. The Court said: 57 It would be inconsistent with that purpose if s 40 agreements as to custody were accorded no status for Hague Convention purposes. It would mean that a non-guardian parent could never rely on a custodial agreement and would have to apply, quite needlessly, to the Family Court to have the agreement embodied in a court order before he could acquire peace of mind. [65] The Court of Appeal acknowledged, however, that courts in other countries have interpreted the definition of “rights of custody” in article 5(a) of the Hague Convention differently. 58 UK case law [66] Mr Fogarty also referred me to the UK Supreme Court decision in re K (A Child) (Reunite International Child Abduction Centre intervening). 59 There Baroness Hale analysed a line of English cases on “inchoate rights”, although the common thread running through those cases was that the mother had either abandoned the child or delegated his/her care to someone else. Baroness Hale said there was nothing in the authorities to suggest that an unmarried father (or anyone else) could acquire rights of custody while the mother, who had sole legal rights, remained the primary carer, whether alone or sharing it with the father."

The cause of death was an undiagnosed perforated ulcer. He was 55 years old. [2] He left behind a de facto partner, Karen Christiansen, and his only child from a previous marriage, Mitch Dodd. [3] In his last will dated 10 June 2010 Chris left his all estate to Mitch (the last will). [4] Chris and Karen had made a property agreement under s 21 of the Property (Relationships) Act 1976 (the PRA) on 25 May 2017 (the property agreement). The property agreement set out what was to happen if their relationship ended on separation or death. [5] Karen is not challenging the property agreement, but she is making a claim under the Family Protection Act 1955 (the FPA) against Chris’s estate on the grounds that Chris breached his duty to make adequate provision for her in his last will. [6] Although the terms of the property agreement prevent Karen from making a claim against Chris’s estate, it is an established rule of law that parties cannot contract out of the provisions of the FPA. 1 [7] The net value of Chris’s estate is approximately $2 million. 2 Karen’s net worth is approximately $2 million 3 . The issue is whether approximately $2 million is adequate provision for Karen and if not, how much Chris should have left her. Chris and Karen [8] When they met Chris and Karen were in their late 40’s. They were a mature couple who had led full lives. They were both working full time and had built up assets over the years. [9] Chris was an electrician who had worked for the same company for many years. His father, Raymond Dodd, had died and his mother, Doreen Dodd, was living 1 Matthews v Phochai [2020] NZHC 3455 at [38] citing Gardiner v Boag [1923] NZLR 739 (SC); Parish v Parish [1924] NZLR 307 (SC); Re Julso [1975] 2 NZLR 536 (SC); Public Trustee v Dillon ([1940] 874 (SC). 2 See schedule1. It is not possible to be precise about the figures in either schedule 1 or 2 because no formal valuations were obtained for any assets and the schedules had some possible omissions. 3 See schedule 2. independently in her own home at New Lynn. His relationships with his mother and his son Mitch were close. [10] Chris had been married twice before and also been in a long term de facto relationship. His first marriage, to Amanda Dodd, was brief and lasted about 7 months to June 1987. His second marriage, to Annette Dodd, lasted about 10 years to December 1998 and produced Mitch, who was born on [date deleted] 1994. After that Chris was in several relationships, including a de facto relationship which lasted for about six years, before he met Karen in 2012. At the time Chris was living in a property he owned at Titirangi. He also had other assets, such as a Kiwisaver fund and a collection of vehicles which included several classic cars. A mortgage over the Titirangi property had been paid off in full. [11] On 10 June 2010 Chris made his last will appointing his lawyer, James Jackson, as executor and directing that after debts, funeral and testamentary expenses and any duties had been paid the residue of his estate was to be given to Mitch. There was also a charging clause. The last will was simple but effective. 4 [12] Karen was working as an accountant. She had qualified as a chartered accountant in her twenties but never worked at an accountancy firm, preferring to work in businesses and change jobs every three or four years. For about five years from her late twenties to mid-thirties she had worked as a flight attendant and travelled the world. After an unhappy relationship ended in her late twenties, she had not re- partnered nor had any children. [13] Over the years she earned the equivalent of about $120,000 a year in today’s terms and built up assets, starting with a property in Massey which she purchased in her 20s with her brother Adrian. Later on she bought Adrian out. By the time she met Chris she had purchased a second property at Sandringham where she was living. The properties were held via a look through company named Pendragon Estates Limited which Karen had set up in 2006 for tax reasons. Karen also owned a Kiwisaver fund, 4 Although it is described in this decision as a “last will” it is in fact the only will Chris is known to have made. life insurance, bonus bonds and vehicles including a classic car collection of her own. Both Karen and Chris were car enthusiasts. [14] In evidence Karen described herself as an independent person with a wide range of interests and activities, many of which she enjoyed with Chris after they became a couple. She said she was “in vibrant good health” and had been a life long runner. Her family members – father, mother, two brothers and their families – were all close and enjoyed good health too. De facto relationship [15] Karen moved into Chris’ Titirangi property in September 2012. They set up a joint account to which they both contributed but otherwise kept their finances separate. Karen sold the Sandringham property and Pendragon received net sale proceeds of about $255,000. The Massey property was rented with the rent used to cover the mortgage and other outgoings. 5 [16] In March 2015 Chris and Karen signed an agreement to buy a section at Mangawhai for $278,500. The purchase was funded with cash and a mortgage of $180,000. Karen says she contributed cash sums of $71,528 and $28,750. Mitch claims that Chris also contributed, and that the cash contributions were not only from Karen. [17] The Mangawhai property was registered in both names. Both parties contributed to the mortgage payments. Karen says that by the end of 2016 the mortgage had been largely repaid, with lump sum payments of $95,000 on 12 December 2016 and $55,000 on 28 November 2016, both made by her. [18] The parties then purchased a property at Kaiwaka for about $300,000, in the name of Pendragon, using the Massey property as collateral. Karen says that Chris did not contribute. A mortgage was raised to complete the purchase with both parties liable. The Kaiwaka property was rented out with the rent used to pay the mortgage and outgoings. 5 Details of the amount secured by the mortgage when the de facto relationship began are not available, but as at the date of the property agreement the amount secured was $212,000. [19] Karen says that she and Chris intended to: 6 28. ... eventually pool our assets in retirement... to build our dream retirement home on my Mangawhai section complete with a veggie garden and fruit trees, with room for a pony for me and a large shed for Chris... ... 30. ... Because our retirement plans necessitated pooling all our assets our plans included our explicit agreement to leave the bulk of our estates to each other. We did not have any immediate plans to retire but decided to go ahead and make the necessary wills to facilitate the process in the long run rather than waiting until we actually retired. 31. ... We periodically talked over and re-affirmed our commitment to our retirement plans including making wills, before and after the [property] agreement [was made]... [20] Chris initiated the property agreement in 2017. By then the parties had been living together for more than three years. [21] Karen says that although she and Chris “had their share of disagreements from time to time” they “enjoyed a comfortable loving relationship. ” Mitch was less positive and says his father wanted the property agreement made after “trust issues” arose over money matters. It is neither possible nor necessary for any finding about this to be made. [22] Chris contacted his lawyer James Jackson in about April 2017 and Mr Jackson took instructions and prepared a draft. Chris discussed the draft with Karen. Some amendments were made."

Today was set down for a half day hearing to progress [Kahu]’s request to see his five tamariki. There are other applications before the Court but when Judge Howard-Sager conferenced this matter on 22 May, her Honour recognised that the most pressing issue was that of getting contact in place for [Kahu] and his tamariki. 1 Procedural matters [2] Today’s hearing has proceeded in a different way because we have a whānau: Mum, Dad and their tamariki who are immersed in Te Ao Māori. Tikanga is very much alive and well within this whānau and is a way of life that these tamariki have been living. [3] Therefore, in terms of procedure I have come off the bench and we are in a joined up octagonal layout. 2 We commenced the hearing with our Te Aō Mārama karakia with mihimihi from myself and then each of the parties. [4] Each party has a support person seated alongside them. [Kahu] has his partner, [Awhina] and [Kiri] has one of [Kahu]’s sisters, [Ātaahua] as her support person. Their lawyer is seated on their other side. [5] Both parties were sworn in at the commencement of the hearing and today’s hearing, at the request of counsel, has proceeded on an inquisitorial basis. As well as the parties, [Kahu]’s paternal aunty, [Hine Teremoana] and [Ātaahua] have given evidence. [6] Some of the kōrero today has been tino taumaha, very heavy. I appreciate that it may been hard for the whanau to hear some of the evidence, and I know that [Kahu] in particular and his partner, [Awhina] became upset with certain statements that were made. However, I have intentionally asked those questions about the two hui that have taken place because I wanted to understand just how much of the parents’ dispute the children were exposed to. [7] I direct the notes of today’s hearing be typed up. I appreciate that the stenographer may have some difficulty with that because we have gone between 1 At the outset, both parties requested to be called by their Māori names, [Kahu] and [Kiri]. 2 I met with counsel immediately prior to court commencing to discuss the tikanga, the way the hearing would proceed and asked that counsel discuss the matter with their client and come back to me before court starts. formal evidence and then discussion, however the notes of the hearing are to be typed up. Introduction [8] [Kahu] and [Kiri] have five tamariki together: [Hemi] is 15, [Tama] is 13, [Hohepa] is 12, [Nikora] is 9 and a half, and [Aroha] turns four in a couple of months. [9] I started off by referring to these children being steeped in tikanga and set out some of the background. [10] Three years ago, [Kahu], some of his siblings and their partners and tamariki/mokopuna decided to quote a phrase from the pleadings: “To decolonise and re-indigenise. ” [11] That to me is about going along a pathway of mana Motuhake; of putting to one side the laws of the Pākehā to reclaim and to live by or at one with the teachings and kōrero tuki iho handed down by their tūpuna. E mihi ana ahau ki te whānau. That is mahi rangatira. [12] The collective is referred to by both parties as [name deleted – “the collective”]. [13] [Kahu]’s older sister [Marama] is a key member of [the collective] and from the pleadings she holds a position of leadership within the whānau. [Marama] is the second eldest in the [Teremoana] whānau. [Tui] who is the mātāmua, or first born, is not involved. [Kahu]’s evidence is that she chose not to go the way of him and his other siblings. [14] This arrangement or way of living went well until it did not go so well. The two hui [15] In April 2023, a hui was called when [the collective] were staying at [town A]. That hui involved the parties and [Kahu]’s siblings. Their tamariki were present. [16] At that hui, [Kahu] was challenged about a sexual relationship he had with his cousin [Iria]. As to the specific details, [Kiri]’s evidence is at odds with [Kahu]’s evidence however they agree that [Kahu] had an extramarital relationship with his cousin. His evidence was he and [Iria] had sex on three separate occasions. This started shortly after the COVID lockdowns. [17] Both parties agreed that the children became upset whilst this korero was being shared. [Kahu] described the children as being disgusted with him and became visibly upset when he recounted what was shared that day. My impression is the children were encouraged to participate in that hui and to express their feelings to their father. [18] [Ātaahua] gave evidence about how her and her siblings were themselves the subject of sexual abuse and how important it is for them to ensure their uri, their children/descendants do not suffer the same consequences. [Ātaahua] expressed that the way to protect children is to discuss openly their concerns around sexually inappropriate behaviour. [19] The phrase tūkino ai was used. When asked to explain what that means to them, the parties and [Ātaahua] agreed that it refers to the wrong way of having sex or in my words, inappropriate sexual relationships. That is clearly what was discussed at that hui openly with the children and has continued to impact on these tamariki and on their relationship with their father. [20] The outcome of that hui was that [Kahu] would leave the whare where they lived, move into a nearby whare and would work through the hara, the wrong that he caused to his whānau. [21] [Kahu] does not accept that his sexual relationship with [Iria] who was in her early 20’s at the time, poses any safety risk to the tamariki. In hindsight, he questions whether they needed to be part of that hui. However, they were; they know about what happened and I have no doubt that the children’s loyalties lie with their mother. [22] There was a second hui about a month later. The evidence is unclear about who called the hui, but it may have been [Kahu]’s older sister, [Marama]. [23] That hui was prompted at least in part, by two videos posted on social media. One video showed [Kahu] being interviewed about [details deleted]. The second video was when he was out with another woman [Awhina] with whom [Kahu] is now in a committed relationship. My impression is that [the collective] was unhappy with [Kahu]’s conduct after the first hui which was to give him time to reflect on the errors of his ways. Although not present for the first part of the hui, the parties tamariki were included towards the end. [24] The consequence of that second hui was that [Kahu]’s relationship with his tamariki and his siblings deteriorated even further. [25] Since then, [Kahu]’s contact with his children has been fairly non-existent and earlier this year, he commenced this court case seeking contact. [26] I find the children have been embroiled in these adult discussions. I understand about the voices of the tamariki being heard. Now the parties are before Te Kōti Whānau, the Care of Children Act 2004 places real emphasis on children’s participation and their voices being heard. [27] However, the Care of Children Act also says that this Court must make decisions that will benefit the children’s welfare and best interests. Whilst their views are particularly important, there are other principles the court must consider in determining welfare and best interests. [28] I am satisfied that these tamariki need to be able to see their dad in a positive way and child-focused manner. 3 They have not had any contact with him since January this year. [29] There was a bit of a kerfuffle in February or at least some postings on Facebook in which [Kahu] did not do himself any favours. I understand your frustration, but the reality is, [Kahu] your tamariki saw what was posted on Facebook and would not have reacted in your favour. 3 Brown v Argyll [2006] NZFLR 705. Restarting contact [30] There is agreement today that contact needs to start. [31] I am grateful to Mr Harte who is the children’s lawyer."
