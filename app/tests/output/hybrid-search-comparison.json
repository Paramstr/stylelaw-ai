[Mr Maguire] noted that “myself and my family have been devastated by the illegal removal of my son [Elliot] from this jurisdiction... ” 49 44 BOD page 385 at [28]. 45 At [32]. 46 At [33]. 47 At [34]. 48 BOD page 455 at [10]. 49 BOD page 456 at [12]. 11 [40] [Ms Carran] married [Braden Archer] in December 2023. He was a friend of her sister and they met when she first visited New Zealand in 2015. 50 They spent more time together when she visited again in 2016 and in June/July 2022. By the time of [Ms Carran]’s affidavit dated 22 November 2023 they were engaged. [41] [Ms Carran] and [Mr Archer] purchased a house together on [location deleted], on 15 September 2023. They each contributed $40,000 although [Ms Carran]’s name is not on the title because [Ms Carran] is currently ineligible to own property in New Zealand. [Ms Carran] and [Mr Archer] are living together with [Elliot] and [Felix] and [Mr Archer] has his 4-year-old daughter in his care two nights per week. 51 [42] In her affidavits, [Ms Carran] said that she has a fantastic job in Christchurch at a [workplace deleted], with flexible hours and good pay, and has recently been promoted to [occupation deleted]. [43] [Ms Carran] says that she had lived in fear of the boys’ fathers in Ireland for multiple years, and that the boys and her family had lived that life with her. 52 She predicted that [Elliot] will not want to return to Ireland. 53 She said his personal circumstances have drastically changed for the better in New Zealand and “he has never been this happy. ” 54 [44] [Ms Carran] deposed in her second and recent affidavit that soon after [Elliot] stopped having contact with his father his addiction to PlayStation stopped and “he now hardly plays on it. ” 55 In that affidavit she states: 56 [Elliot] has flourished in New Zealand. He has settled with a consistent routine and support. He is open and relaxed. His physical appearance has changed drastically due to him being far more active. Emotionally, he has opened up to me and [Braden]. [Elliot] had been a closed book for a very long time. He now enjoys everything life throws everything at him. He loves mountain biking and skiing. He attends swimming lessons every [week]. This is notably different form his life in Ireland where I would struggle to get [Elliot] out of the house. 50 At [36]. 51 Affidavit of [Braden Archer] (in [Felix]’s proceeding) dated 8 November 2023. 52 BOD page 387 at [48]. 53 At [53]. 54 At [55]. 55 BOD page 539 at [15]. 56 At [32]. 12 [45] [Ms Carran] disputes [Mr Maguire]’s advice to Mr Abrahamson, as recorded in the s 133 report, 57 that she did not inform [Mr Maguire] she was making the trip to New Zealand in November 2022. [Ms Carran] has deposed that [Mr Maguire] was informed of the trip in June 2022. 58 [46] Ms Abrahamson records in her report advice from [Ms Carran] that she will not return to Ireland herself, even if the boys are ordered to return. 59 Both boys are aware that is their mother’s position. 60 [47] [Mr Maguire] deposed in his recent and final affidavit dated 15 March 2024, that if [Elliot] is returned to Ireland and [Ms Carran] elects to stay in New Zealand, [Elliot] would reside with him and be enrolled at the local secondary school. He said that his sister, brother and parents and [Elliot]’s first cousins all live within a 10-mile radius and there would be daily visits and support. [Elliot] will be encouraged and supported in engaging in extracurricular activities in the area, such as tennis, cycling, athletics, rugby, soccer, hurling, and Gaelic football. [48] [Mr Maguire] says that if [Felix] is returned to Mr [Barclay]’s care in Ireland, they will be within five minutes of each other and [Mr Maguire] assures the Court that the sibling relationship will be nurtured. [Mr Maguire] deposed that he will also facilitate whatever contact [Elliot] wants and/or the Court directs with [Ms Carran]. 61 [49] [Mr Maguire]’s plea to the New Zealand Court is to return [Elliot] to his habitual home so that the Irish Court can deal with the matter in the appropriate fashion. 62 57 S 133 report, page 7 at [17]. 58 BOD page 539 at [16]. 59 Report page 9, at [23]. 60 Page 16, at [48] and page 18 at [61]. 61 BOD page 533 and 534. 62 BOD page 456 at [13]. 13 Child objection defence [50] Section 106(1)(d) of the Act provides the defence of “child objection” encapsulated by article 13 of the Hague Convention, the relevant part of which reads as follows: ... the judicial or administrative authority may also refuse to order the return of the child if it finds that the child objects to being returned and has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of its views. [51] It is now well settled that the assessment of a child objection defence, requires a four-step process and analysis: 63 • Does the child object to return? If so; • Has the child attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to give weight to the child's views? If so; • What weight should be given to the child's views? And; • How should the residual statutory discretion be exercised? [52] Ms Park also referred me to UK House of Lords decision in Re: D as long ago as 2006 where Baroness Hale said: 64 .. there is now a growing understanding of the importance of listening to the children involved in children's cases. It is the child, more than anyone else, who will have to live with what the court decides. Those who do listen to children understand that they often have a point of view which is quite distinct from that of the person looking after them. They are quite capable of being moral actors in their own right. Just as the adults may have to do what the court decides whether they like it or not, so may the child. But that is no more a reason for failing to hear what the child has to say than it is for refusing to hear the parents' views. [53] All counsel referred me to numerous different cases, and to many of the same cases, but all cases under the Act and Hague Convention are necessarily fact specific. [54] Mr Logan, in his submissions for [Mr Maguire], responsibly and appropriately conceded the first two steps of the four-step process identified above. [Elliot] is 63 White v Northumberland [2006] NZFLR 1105 (CA) at [47] confirming on appeal the approach of Chisholm J in the Christchurch High Court in W v N [2006] NZFLR 793 at [46]. 64 Re D (a child) (abduction: rights of custody) [2007] 1 All ER 783 at [57]. 14 objecting to return to Ireland, and he has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to give weight to his views. [55] In the last several months, since the appointment of Mr Wren as [Elliot]’s lawyer in mid-November 2023, [Elliot] has clearly and consistently voiced to Mr Wren, to Ms Abrahamson, to me at my judicial interview, through his mother’s evidence, and to his father in phone calls, an objection to returning to Ireland. [56] At 14 years old and given the particular provision and wording in the Hague Convention itself, 65 the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCROC) 66 and ss 6(2)(b) and s 7AA of the Act, not to mention simple fairness and common sense, it is appropriate to give weight to [Elliot]’s views. [57] The critical question, is how much weight should be given to [Elliot]’s views? What weight should be given to [Elliot]’s views? [58] The High Court considered this issue of the weight to be given to the objection of an 11-year-old child on an appeal from a Family Court decision to order the return of the child to the United States, in Anderson v Lewis. 67 Mander J said as follows: 68 [128] The next question is the weight that should be given to the child's views. In carrying out that exercise, a number of factors are required to be taken into account. These include the nature and strength of the child's objections, the extent to which they are authentically those of the child or the product of the influence of the parents, and the extent to which they align or conflict with other considerations relevant to the child's welfare, and the important policy objectives the Hague Convention seeks to advance."

        "content": "This is, they did behind us. [69] While there is some considerable doubt about it, I have not been satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Mr [HD] and Ms [TW] knew about the romantic relationship between their daughter and Ms [TW] prior to these Court proceedings. The obvious point is that it is highly unlikely they would have transferred money to Ms [SD] as frequently and as freely as they did, had they known about the relationship or even the remotest possibility or concern that there could be a relationship property claim against Ms [SD]. 101 NOE, page 241, line 30. 102 NOE, page 268, line 16. 24 [70] Ms [SD] acquired a 2010 Lexus car in December 2019, soon after she started her full-time job in [town A], which car was funded by money Ms [LZ] transferred to her own ANZ account from China, and which funds Ms [SD] was then able to access. [71] On 20 September 2019 Ms [LZ] deposited $30,000 in her ANZ Go account (suffix 00). 103 On 25 September 2019 Ms [SD] transferred $25,000 from the Go account to Ms [LZ]’s 50 “Serious Saver” account. 104 From Ms [LZ]’s 50 account three payments were made to “Autoterminal” for the Lexus car: • 8 October 2019 $8,500 105 • 2 December 2019 $6,799 106 • 2 December 2019 $10,000 107 $25,299 [72] As I mentioned, Ms [TW] returned to China in early [2020] to visit her family, and then got stuck there due to the COVID lockdown and border closure. [73] It was on 19 April 2020 that Ms [SD] advised Ms [TW] via a WeChat message that she had cheated on her with another woman who was a colleague. The screenshots of the messages which Ms [SD] attached to her first affidavit as Annexure “A” run to nine pages and are unequivocal. They include the following exchanges: 108 Ms [SD]: I am sorry, but I don’t want to cheat you, I cheated on you, did what I was most ashamed of. Ms [TW]: So you’re breaking up with me? ... Ms [SD]: Let’s break up. I know it’s cruel to tell you at this point. Ms [TW]: And who? Ms [SD]: Colleague. Ms [TW]: You’re getting together? 103 BOD, page 1215. 104 BOD, page 1216 and NOE, page 98, line 1. 105 BOD, page 1245. 106 BOD, page 1243. 107 Ibid. 108 BOD, page 520 to 528. 25 Ms [SD]: not necessarily. Ms [SD]: But I think it’s better to break up with you. ... Ms [TW]: When did this happen? Ms [SD]: These two days. Ms [TW]: Indian colleague? ... Ms [SD]: Yes. Ms [SD]: Also a roommate. Ms [TW]: Okay. ... Ms [TW]: So you’re gonna stay with her for a while? Ms [SD]: Yes. Ms [SD]: But I want to go out for a while before I decide. [74] Ms [TW]’s affidavit evidence was that the relationship “deteriorated” in mid- April 2020 when Ms [SD] told her about the affair, 109 but she said that they remained in contact and continued to have long phone conversations. She deposed that the parties separated on 5 August 2020 when Ms [SD] informed her she had unilaterally withdrawn their joint residence visa application in July. 110 [75] I do not accept that the parties continued to be in a relationship after Ms [SD] informed Ms [TW] of her affair on 19 April. Ms [TW] has not provided evidence of regular or amicable communication, let alone any declarations of love or forgiveness after 19 April and I am influenced in my conclusion by the affidavit evidence of the parties’ mutual friend, [YK], who was not required for cross-examination. 109 BOD, page 373 at [43]. 110 At [44]. 26 [76] Ms [YK] deposed that while communicating with Ms [TW] via WeChat in July 2020, Ms [TW] said that she had split up with Ms [SD] in April. 111 Ms [YK] provided an English translation from a translation service of the WeChat message where Ms [TW] said, “I haven’t told you that I actually broke up with her in April. ” Ms [TW]’s follow-up message, sent the same day, 18 July 2020, said “Might as well tell you today, [you] will find out anyway”. 112 [77] Accordingly, and as noted earlier, I find that the date of separation was 19 April 2020 as stated by Ms [SD], and not 5 August 2020 as argued by Ms [TW]. [78] Ms [TW] was able to return to Christchurch [in 2020]. 113 At that stage she was still completing her [education details deleted]. Ms [TW] acknowledged that she obtained an internship in [2021] 114 and has been working full-time since she graduated in [2021]. [79] Ms [TW] lived at the [address 1] property from [mid-2020] until [mid-2021]. She said that she moved out of [address 1] as soon as she secured full-time employment. 115 However, it was not until 6 October 2021 that her (former) solicitor advised Ms Park by email that Ms [TW] had moved out of the [address 1] property. 116 [80] Ms [TW] has also acknowledged that she received and used rental of $5,760 from tenants in the home between August and December 2020. 117 Ms [TW] said in her oral evidence that three bedrooms were still rented out when she returned to New Zealand [in mid-2020]. 118 Gradually the tenants all moved out and it was just Ms [TW] in the house as from [early 2021]. 119 111 BOD, page 1298 at [8]. 112 BOD, page 1350. 113 NOE, page 110, line 1. 114 NOE, page 109, line 25. 115 NOE, page 110, lines 7 to 9. 116 BOD, page 417. 117 BOD, page 311 at [6(a)]. 118 NOE, page 110, line 21. 119 NOE, page 111, lines 27 to 30. 27 [81] Ms [TW]’s evidence was that she was not able to sign tenancy agreements as the landlord to rent rooms to new tenants because the house was registered in Ms [SD]’s name and Ms [SD] did not agree to Ms [TW] arranging further tenants. 120 [82] Ms [SD] confirmed that [address 1] has been rented again as from 19 April 2022 and has been managed since then by a rental management company, Rempstone. 121 Ms [SD] advised that the house is now rented to one tenant for $970 per week. 122 [83] It is agreed that Ms [SD] paid $7,500 to Ms [TW] on 1 September 2020, being one half of the $15,000 that Ms [SD] had withdrawn from the joint 02 account on 20 July 2020. 123 The respective ANZ joint account balances at the date of separation (19 April 2020) were $6,088. 98 124 and $9,611. 37, 125 so $15,700 in total. That being the case, and as conceded by Ms [TW] she is required to account for the $4,000 that she withdrew from the joint 02 account on 13 July 2020 126 to fund her airfares from China to New Zealand. [84] The most recent developments are that Ms [SD] moved from [town A] to [town B] in April 2022 127 to take up a new job as a [job title deleted]. Ms [SD] was made redundant from that position only a couple of weeks before the hearing, on 17 April 2024, 128 and does not yet have new employment. [85] Ms [SD] purchased a three-bedroom house in [town B] in [2023] for $800,000 with significant assistance from her parents who gifted her half the purchase price. The balance was borrowed from the bank. The house is registered in Ms [SD]’s sole name. 129 120 BOD, page 14, at [73]. 121 NOE, page 203, line 7. 122 NOE, page 119, lines 12 to 26. 123 BOD, page 23. 124 BOD, page 601. 125 BOD, page 643. 126 BOD, page 23. 127 NOE, page 229, line 5. 128 NOE, page 115, line 31. 129 NOE, page 229, line 29, to page 230, line 17. 28 [86] Ms [SD] now has permanent residency in New Zealand. 130 Ms [TW] is not yet a permanent resident but has a residency visa. She advised that she will receive permanent residency in 12 months’ time. 131 [87] Having set out the background in some detail, I turn now to the particular legal issues and decisions on those issues. Is the [address 1] property held on resulting trust? [88] For Mr [HD] and Ms [LZ] it is pleaded that the [address 1] property is held for them (by Ms [SD]) on resulting trust. [89] As noted by the Court of Appeal in Chang v Lee 132 the principle of resulting trust was explained by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in the House of Lords in Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Burrough Council 133 and arises in circumstances where: “ ... A makes a voluntary payment to B or pays (wholly or in part) for the purchase of a property which is vested in either B alone or in the joint names of A and B, there is a presumption that A did not intend to make a gift to B; the money or property is held on trust for A (if he is the sole provider of the money) or in the case of the joint purchase by A and B in shares proportionate to their contribution. It is important to stress that this is only a presumption, which presumption can be easily rebutted either by the counter- presumption of advancement or by direct evidence of A's intention to make an outright transfer ... ” [90] Lord Browne-Wilkinson went on to state that: “ ... resulting trust[s] are traditionally regarded as examples of trusts giving effect to the common intention of the parties. A resulting trust is not imposed by law against the intentions of the trustee (as is a constructive trust) but gives effect to his presumed intention. ..."

        "content": "60 [67] In the course of her decision, and referring to the concept of “inchoate rights”, Baroness Hale commented that there is “very little support for such an expansive view of rights of custody among the other states parties to the Convention”. 61 She noted that Ireland had expressly refused to recognise it in an incoming case from the United States. 62 57 Fairfax v Ireton [2009] 3 NZLR 289 at [58]. 58 At [65]. 59 Re K (A Child) (Reunite International Child Abduction Centre intervening) [2014] 2 WLR 1304. 60 At [26] and [59]. 61 At [57]. 62 At [33]. 18 The law in Ireland [68] The wording of both article 3 of the Convention and s 97 of the Care of Children Act make it clear that it is rights of custody in relation to the child “under the law of the State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the child’s removal” which is relevant. The critical question and issue, therefore, is did [Mr Barclay] have rights of custody in Ireland as at 15 November 2022? [69] The starting point is the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, which is the equivalent of our Care of Children Act. 63 For convenience I shall refer to the Guardianship of Infants Act as “GIA”, a copy of which Mr Morrisey annexed to his affidavit. 64 [70] In the GIA “infant” is defined as “a person under 21 years of age” and “father” includes “a male adopter under an adoption order but does not include the natural father of an illegitimate infant”. 65 [71] Section 6(4) goes on to say that “the mother of an illegitimate infant shall be guardian of the infant” and s 6A, as inserted by s 12 of the Status of Children Act 1987, provides that “where the father and mother have not married each other, the court may, on the application of the father, by order appoint him to be a guardian of the infant”. [72] Section 10(2)(a) then states that a guardian “shall, as against every person not being, jointly with him, a guardian of the person, be entitled to custody of the infant”. [73] Accordingly, the Irish statute does not recognise the father of an illegitimate infant (ie: an unmarried father) but the natural father has the ability to bring an application to the court. Section 11(2)(a) of the GIA further provides that the court may by an order under s 11 “give such directions as it thinks proper regarding the custody of the infant and the rights of access to the infant of his father or mother”. 63 As per s 104(1)(b)(ii) and (3)(b) of the Care of Children Act [Mr Barclay]’s Irish solicitor, Mr Morrissey, provided an affidavit concerning the relevant law of the Contracting State of the child’s habitual residence. 64 BOD, page 6. 65 Section 2. 19 [74] Section 11(4) of the GIA states “in the case of an illegitimate infant the right to make an application under this section regarding the custody of the infant and the right of access thereto of his father or mother shall extend to the natural father of the infant and for this purpose references in this section to the father or parent of an infant shall be construed as including him”. [75] As mentioned earlier, neither parent ever filed an application for a custody or access order under the GIA, and [Mr Barclay] was not appointed a guardian of [Felix] until 9 March 2023, nearly four months after [Ms Carran] had removed [Felix] from Ireland. [76] Hence [Ms Carran] pleading in her notice of response that “the applicant did not have guardianship rights or rights to custody when [Felix] left Ireland” 66 and, on the face of it, she is correct. Pursuant to the provisions of the GIA [Ms Carran] was [Felix]’s sole guardian and was entitled to his custody. [77] This begs the question or next issue as to the applicability or validity of “inchoate” or more informal rights of custody as have been recognised in New Zealand. [78] Ms Park helpfully referred me to a decision of the Ireland Supreme Court on this very issue, J. McB v L E 67 . In that case Mr McB, who was Irish, and Ms E, who was English, met in England and subsequently lived together in England, Australia, Northern Ireland and Ireland, but never married. [79] They had three children and came to live in Ireland in 2008 when the children were 7½, 6 and 1 respectively. They separated for a while in or about early 2009 but reconciled in April 2009. They had decided to get married and their wedding was scheduled for 10 October 2009 but whilst Mr McB was away on a 10 day training course in July 2009 Ms E took the children and went to a women’s refuge. Mr McB had continuing contact with the children and there is mention in the judgment that despite accusations against Mr McB, which he denied, Ms E left him a letter in which 66 BOD, page 97. 67 J. McB v L E [2010] IESC 48. 20 she said “I would never deprive the kids of you... I am not taking the kids away from you... you are a good dad”. [80] On 25 July 2009, so only two weeks later, Ms E took the children to England without informing Mr McB beforehand and she did not return. Ten days before that, on 15 July, Mr McB had instructed his solicitors to prepare an application under the GIA for an order appointing him to be a guardian of the children, but the application had not been served and the jurisdiction of the District Court had not, therefore, been invoked at the date of the removal of the children from Ireland. [81] Mr McB then applied to the English Court for an order for the return of the children to Ireland pursuant to the legislation of the UK giving effect to the Hague Convention. The English Court, in turn, requested that Mr McB obtain from the High Court of Ireland a decision or determination that the removal of the children from Ireland was wrongful within the meaning of article 3. [82] The High Court held that Mr McB had not enjoyed any rights of custody in respect of the children at the time of their removal from Ireland. Mr McB then appealed to the Supreme Court. [83] It was argued that the rights of custody protected by the Hague Convention include those of an unmarried father where he is living with and by agreement exercising day-to-day care of the children. Mr McB said he was in the process of asserting his right to apply to be appointed a guardian for the children when they were removed, and it was understandable that he had not previously done so. It was submitted that the Court should, in an appropriate case, be prepared to recognise “inchoate rights” of a natural father who had not obtained recognition of his position in the form of a court order, at least where he was carrying out duties and enjoying privileges of a custodial character. 68 68 At [22]. 21 [84] The Supreme Court, which was a full bench of five Justices, found that Mr McB did not have rights of custody in respect of the children at the time of their removal from Ireland and said as follows: 69 The Irish courts interpret the rights of parents and of their children whether within a family based on marriage or in relationships outside marriage in accordance with Irish law, both statute and common law, and the Constitution, which accords a special position to the family and, in particular, to the family based on marriage. Under section 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights Act, 2003, the courts are obliged to interpret and apply any statutory provision or rule of law, in so far as is possible, subject to the rules of law relating to such interpretation and application, in a manner compatible with the State’s obligations under the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights. Section 4(1)(a) of that Act requires the courts to take judicial notice, inter alia, of the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. [85] The Court referred to s 6A of the GIA which I quoted earlier, which refers to the right of an unmarried father to seek an order appointing him as a guardian of the infant. It then said: [31] Thus, the natural father has the right expressly conferred by statute to apply to be appointed as guardian of his child and an independent right to apply for orders granting him custody or access. The court hearing any such application is obliged by law to treat the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration. [32] A court when considering an application of a natural father to be appointed as guardian will have regard to all the circumstances of the relationship which exists between the father and the child."

[3] In his last will dated 10 June 2010 Chris left his all estate to Mitch (the last will). [4] Chris and Karen had made a property agreement under s 21 of the Property (Relationships) Act 1976 (the PRA) on 25 May 2017 (the property agreement). The property agreement set out what was to happen if their relationship ended on separation or death. [5] Karen is not challenging the property agreement, but she is making a claim under the Family Protection Act 1955 (the FPA) against Chris’s estate on the grounds that Chris breached his duty to make adequate provision for her in his last will. [6] Although the terms of the property agreement prevent Karen from making a claim against Chris’s estate, it is an established rule of law that parties cannot contract out of the provisions of the FPA. 1 [7] The net value of Chris’s estate is approximately $2 million. 2 Karen’s net worth is approximately $2 million 3 . The issue is whether approximately $2 million is adequate provision for Karen and if not, how much Chris should have left her. Chris and Karen [8] When they met Chris and Karen were in their late 40’s. They were a mature couple who had led full lives. They were both working full time and had built up assets over the years. [9] Chris was an electrician who had worked for the same company for many years. His father, Raymond Dodd, had died and his mother, Doreen Dodd, was living 1 Matthews v Phochai [2020] NZHC 3455 at [38] citing Gardiner v Boag [1923] NZLR 739 (SC); Parish v Parish [1924] NZLR 307 (SC); Re Julso [1975] 2 NZLR 536 (SC); Public Trustee v Dillon ([1940] 874 (SC). 2 See schedule1. It is not possible to be precise about the figures in either schedule 1 or 2 because no formal valuations were obtained for any assets and the schedules had some possible omissions. 3 See schedule 2. independently in her own home at New Lynn. His relationships with his mother and his son Mitch were close. [10] Chris had been married twice before and also been in a long term de facto relationship. His first marriage, to Amanda Dodd, was brief and lasted about 7 months to June 1987. His second marriage, to Annette Dodd, lasted about 10 years to December 1998 and produced Mitch, who was born on [date deleted] 1994. After that Chris was in several relationships, including a de facto relationship which lasted for about six years, before he met Karen in 2012. At the time Chris was living in a property he owned at Titirangi. He also had other assets, such as a Kiwisaver fund and a collection of vehicles which included several classic cars. A mortgage over the Titirangi property had been paid off in full. [11] On 10 June 2010 Chris made his last will appointing his lawyer, James Jackson, as executor and directing that after debts, funeral and testamentary expenses and any duties had been paid the residue of his estate was to be given to Mitch. There was also a charging clause. The last will was simple but effective. 4 [12] Karen was working as an accountant. She had qualified as a chartered accountant in her twenties but never worked at an accountancy firm, preferring to work in businesses and change jobs every three or four years. For about five years from her late twenties to mid-thirties she had worked as a flight attendant and travelled the world. After an unhappy relationship ended in her late twenties, she had not re- partnered nor had any children. [13] Over the years she earned the equivalent of about $120,000 a year in today’s terms and built up assets, starting with a property in Massey which she purchased in her 20s with her brother Adrian. Later on she bought Adrian out. By the time she met Chris she had purchased a second property at Sandringham where she was living. The properties were held via a look through company named Pendragon Estates Limited which Karen had set up in 2006 for tax reasons. Karen also owned a Kiwisaver fund, 4 Although it is described in this decision as a “last will” it is in fact the only will Chris is known to have made. life insurance, bonus bonds and vehicles including a classic car collection of her own. Both Karen and Chris were car enthusiasts. [14] In evidence Karen described herself as an independent person with a wide range of interests and activities, many of which she enjoyed with Chris after they became a couple. She said she was “in vibrant good health” and had been a life long runner. Her family members – father, mother, two brothers and their families – were all close and enjoyed good health too. De facto relationship [15] Karen moved into Chris’ Titirangi property in September 2012. They set up a joint account to which they both contributed but otherwise kept their finances separate. Karen sold the Sandringham property and Pendragon received net sale proceeds of about $255,000. The Massey property was rented with the rent used to cover the mortgage and other outgoings. 5 [16] In March 2015 Chris and Karen signed an agreement to buy a section at Mangawhai for $278,500. The purchase was funded with cash and a mortgage of $180,000. Karen says she contributed cash sums of $71,528 and $28,750. Mitch claims that Chris also contributed, and that the cash contributions were not only from Karen. [17] The Mangawhai property was registered in both names. Both parties contributed to the mortgage payments. Karen says that by the end of 2016 the mortgage had been largely repaid, with lump sum payments of $95,000 on 12 December 2016 and $55,000 on 28 November 2016, both made by her. [18] The parties then purchased a property at Kaiwaka for about $300,000, in the name of Pendragon, using the Massey property as collateral. Karen says that Chris did not contribute. A mortgage was raised to complete the purchase with both parties liable. The Kaiwaka property was rented out with the rent used to pay the mortgage and outgoings. 5 Details of the amount secured by the mortgage when the de facto relationship began are not available, but as at the date of the property agreement the amount secured was $212,000. [19] Karen says that she and Chris intended to: 6 28. ... eventually pool our assets in retirement... to build our dream retirement home on my Mangawhai section complete with a veggie garden and fruit trees, with room for a pony for me and a large shed for Chris... ... 30. ... Because our retirement plans necessitated pooling all our assets our plans included our explicit agreement to leave the bulk of our estates to each other. We did not have any immediate plans to retire but decided to go ahead and make the necessary wills to facilitate the process in the long run rather than waiting until we actually retired. 31. ... We periodically talked over and re-affirmed our commitment to our retirement plans including making wills, before and after the [property] agreement [was made]... [20] Chris initiated the property agreement in 2017. By then the parties had been living together for more than three years. [21] Karen says that although she and Chris “had their share of disagreements from time to time” they “enjoyed a comfortable loving relationship. ” Mitch was less positive and says his father wanted the property agreement made after “trust issues” arose over money matters. It is neither possible nor necessary for any finding about this to be made. [22] Chris contacted his lawyer James Jackson in about April 2017 and Mr Jackson took instructions and prepared a draft. Chris discussed the draft with Karen. Some amendments were made."

        "content": "It is well known that there is a potentially enormous variation in such relationships ranging from the position of the father of a child conceived as the result of casual or commercial intercourse or even rape, where the rights might well be so minimal as practically to be non-existent, to the situation of a child born as the result of a stable and established relationship and nurtured from the commencement of his or her life by the father with the mother in an environment bearing almost all of the characteristics of a family founded on marriage, when the rights would be very extensive indeed. [33] Thus, the courts recognise the blood link between a natural father and his child as an important element which establishes a biological relationship, but which does not, without more, confer any rights on the natural father ... The relationship must be judged by a court in the light of all the circumstances of the case but always subject to the overriding consideration of the best interests of the child. The law grants to the natural father a right to apply to the court; the court must consider the extent of his rights as well as those of the mother and of the child. Recognising the existence of the biological relationship between the father and the child, the law grants to the court the power 69 At [28]. 22 to regulate and control the scope and ambit of that relationship in an application for guardianship or custody on the part of the natural father. Thus, a natural father has no rights of custody in Irish law in the absence of a court order granting them. For the sake of completeness, it should be said that it follows that a natural father has no right to determine the place of residence of his child save as may be granted to him pursuant to a court order. [86] The Court also noted: [35] The Irish courts, in the interpretation and application of the Hague Convention, have, as the law stands, declined to recognise as amounting to rights of custody under the Hague Convention, the “inchoate rights” of those who are carrying out duties and enjoying privileges of a custodial or parental character though not yet formally recognised or granted by law. [37] It is the view of the Supreme Court that nothing in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights suggests that the provisions of Irish law with regard to the rights of custody of a natural father in respect of his child are incompatible with the Convention ... The Supreme Court is of the view, in the light of the infinite variation of extra-marital relationships and consequent relationships with children, that the requirement for a court order to give legal force to the right of custody of a natural father is necessary and appropriate and not disproportionate to the objective of protection of the best interests of the child. [38] Accordingly, the Supreme Court remains satisfied that the appellant did not have rights of custody in respect of his children for the purpose of article 5 of the Hague Convention on 25th July 2009. [87] Nonetheless, the Irish Supreme Court decided to stay the proceedings and referred a question to the European Court of Justice for a ruling. The particular question posed for the European Court of Justice was whether a member state was precluded from: 70 ... requiring by its law that the father of a child who is not married to the mother shall have obtained an order of a court of competent jurisdiction granting him custody in order to qualify as having “custody rights” which render the removal of that child from its country of habitual residence wrongful. [88] In response, the European Court of Justice noted that: 71 The referring court states that, under Irish law, the natural father does not have rights of custody in respect of his child, unless those rights are conferred on 70 At [44]. 71 Judgment of the Court (Third Chamber) 5 October 2010 In Case C-400/10 PPU at [48]. 23 him by an agreement entered into by the parents or by a court judgment, whereas such rights of custody automatically belong to the mother, and no attribution of them to her is necessary. [89] The Court commented 72 that the European Court of Human Rights had already considered a case with comparable facts and ruled that national legislation granting, by operation of law, parental responsibility for such a child solely to the child’s mother is not contrary to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, provided that it permits the child’s father, not vested with parental responsibility, to ask the national court with jurisdiction to vary the award of that responsibility. [90] The Court further noted that the European Court of Human Rights had previously ruled that national legislation which does not allow the natural father any possibility of obtaining rights of custody in respect of his child in the absence of the mother’s agreement, constitutes unjustified discrimination against the father. 73 The Court of Justice said this finding: 74 ... is not invalidated by the fact that, if steps are not taken by such a father in good time to obtain rights of custody, he finds himself unable, if the child is removed to another Member State by its mother, to obtain the return of that child to the Member State where the child previously had its habitual residence. Such a removal represents the legitimate exercise, by the mother with custody of the child, of her own right of freedom of movement... and of her right to determine the child’s place of residence, and that does not deprive the natural father of the possibility of exercising his right to submit an application to obtain rights of custody thereafter in respect of that child or rights of access to that child. [91] Accordingly, the European Court of Justice agreed with the Irish Supreme Court. A Member State is not precluded from providing by its law that the acquisition of rights of custody by a child’s father, where he is not married to the child’s mother, is dependent on the father obtaining a judgment from a national court with jurisdiction awarding such rights to him, on the basis of which the removal of the child by its mother or the retention of that child may be considered wrongful. 75 72 At [54]. 73 At [56]. 74 At [58]. 75 At [64]. 24 [92] Again, the fact is that [Mr Barclay] did not have a court order from Ireland granting him rights of custody or access. Consequently, and as harsh a result as it is for [Mr Barclay] in circumstances where he had been having regular access with [Felix] from the date of the parties’ separation in April 2016 and right up until [Felix]’s removal from Ireland in November 2022, he did not have “rights of custody” in terms of Irish law. [93] It is apparent that the law and also the Constitution in Ireland accords special status and/or protection to relationships founded on marriage. In her written submissions Ms Park referred me to article 41 of the Constitution of Ireland which is about the family. It states: 1(i) The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law. (ii) The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State. [94] Further in article 41 the Constitution states: 3(i) The State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of Marriage, on which the Family is founded, and to protect it against attack. [95] Ms Park advised in her written submissions that in March 2024 voters in the Republic of Ireland overwhelmingly voted against a proposed amendment to the Constitution. Research has confirmed that the referendum proposed to expand the constitutional definition of Family to include “other durable relationships” outside of marriage and 67. 7 per cent voted “no”. Decision [96] Given that this is the clear position in Irish law and the Irish Supreme Court and the Irish public in the form of the recent (2024) referendum have expressly considered but rejected relaxing that law, it is not for me in the Christchurch Family Court in New Zealand to tell Ireland that they have got that wrong. 25 [97] The Hague Convention itself and the Care of Children Act in respect of applying the Hague Convention, 76 expressly refers to rights of custody under the law of the Contracting State in question. That is Ireland in this case, and I am satisfied that in Irish law [Mr Barclay] did not have rights of custody as at November 2022 when [Ms Carran] removed [Felix] from Ireland to New Zealand."
