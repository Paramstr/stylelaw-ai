      "content": "Specifically, the High Court in Pyke v Sherriff 21 recognised and upheld the earlier approach of a full bench of the High Court in R v S 22 where Heath J held: “In my view, it is wrong in principle to make an adverse order for costs against a parent who advances a genuine and responsible argument in what he or she regards as the best interest of the child. If costs orders are made in those circumstances, they may operate as a disincentive for such arguments to be put to the court. As the Family Court, in guardianship proceedings, exercises an inquisitorial jurisdiction, it is important that all relevant arguments be put before the court... further, I am of the view that, particularly in a case where 16 s 135A(4), Care of Children Act 2004. 17 s 4(1)(a), Care of Children Act 2004. 18 [1997] 15 FRNZ 706 (HC) 19 Re Karaka [2016] NZHC 183, at [29] & [40]. 20 This is well-established law - see, for example, Kacem v Bashir or Brown v Argyle. 21 [2017] NZHC 1990. 22 [2004] NZFLR 207. the Judge does not appear to have made any determinations of credibility as between the parents and where the case might properly be said to be finally balanced, it is wrong, as a matter of principle, for costs automatically to follow the event in such proceedings... ” [22] In light of Re Karaka, I consider that this dicta should likewise be applicable to cost contribution orders, and the matters set out above be relevant considerations of “circumstances” for the purposes of s 135A(4). [23] In this case, the proceedings commenced as an application by Ms [Gauri] to obtain assistance to resolve difficulties between the parties in the circumstances that I have already outlined. But those proceedings have now been resolved without a hearing, reflecting the desirability arising from s 5(c) of the Act for parties to resolve matters like these. Thus, neither party required the court to determine an outcome for them, and it was in [Jothi]’s best interests for the court to be able to conclude this proceeding without a hearing which will potentially polarise her parents in their respective positions and place them in an adversarial setting against each other. [24] Without such a hearing, however, neither party is now able to establish - to the requisite standard – that the position which they have, or may have, advanced during this proceeding as to [Jothi]’s care arrangements is more correct than the position advanced by the other parent. Consequently, by otherwise promoting [Jothi]’s welfare as outlined above, the parties become legally unable to persuade the court to properly consider their liability for lawyer for child costs with reference to the provisions of the Act – specifically s 135A(4) – as they would otherwise be entitled to do. [25] In these circumstances where the parties have achieved an agreed outcome and where there cannot be any genuine suggestion that either has taken a position that was not “.. a genuine and responsible argument” 23 as to the [Jothi]’s welfare, I consider that it would be contrary to both [Jothi]’s interests, and the interests of justice to then financially “penalise” the parties – and therefore also [Jothi], as outlined further below. [26] Any order made pursuant to s 135A would impact the parties. Funds not available to them due to having to meet the costs of lawyer for child’s appointment detracts from finances available to them for [Jothi]’s benefit. This further weighs against the making of orders requiring the parents to make a cost contribution. Although I apply that as a consideration in this case, I hasten to add that this is an 23 As per R v S, cited at n 9 above. argument that should be considered by the court with caution (as it could arise in every proceeding). But it remains one of a number of relevant considerations. [27] For these reasons, therefore, I concluded that circumstances of this case warranted an outcome that does not require either party to contribute towards the cost of lawyer for child’s appointment. Final words [28] I reserve my final words for the parties. There should be no criticism (either inferred from my decision or in general) of Ms [Gauri] for taking legal steps to obtain assistance from the court in the circumstances that she did – irrespective of whether she or Mr [Lata] may now wonder whether her reasons to start proceedings were misconceived or not. The options available to her through access to the court and its processes are fundamentally important. I hope that I have acknowledged that. I have also aimed to appropriately respect what I consider to be Ms [Gauri]’s right to ask the proceedings to come to an end if they will no longer serve their intended purpose. [29] To Mr [Lata] (and, to a degree, to Ms [Gauri] as well), I simply make it clear that Ms [Gauri] will have every right to return to the court if a situation should develop in the future where she has concerns for her safety, and/or [Jothi]’s safety. Mr [Lata], this judgment now registers, as a matter of record, your acknowledgement that family violence is unacceptable, and that you understand what family violence is. If the court is required to look at matters again because situations deteriorate between you and Ms [Gauri] in the future, then the court may have difficulty accepting a response of ignorance of the law or family violence – that is to say, Mr [Lata], that you were unaware that such behaviour constituted family violence and/or was unacceptable. [30] I sincerely hope, however, that that will not be necessary and that neither party will have any need for court intervention in the future. I emphasise, however, yet again that the processes will remain available to the parties should the need arise."

      "content": "This is, they did behind us. [69] While there is some considerable doubt about it, I have not been satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Mr [HD] and Ms [TW] knew about the romantic relationship between their daughter and Ms [TW] prior to these Court proceedings. The obvious point is that it is highly unlikely they would have transferred money to Ms [SD] as frequently and as freely as they did, had they known about the relationship or even the remotest possibility or concern that there could be a relationship property claim against Ms [SD]. 101 NOE, page 241, line 30. 102 NOE, page 268, line 16. 24 [70] Ms [SD] acquired a 2010 Lexus car in December 2019, soon after she started her full-time job in [town A], which car was funded by money Ms [LZ] transferred to her own ANZ account from China, and which funds Ms [SD] was then able to access. [71] On 20 September 2019 Ms [LZ] deposited $30,000 in her ANZ Go account (suffix 00). 103 On 25 September 2019 Ms [SD] transferred $25,000 from the Go account to Ms [LZ]’s 50 “Serious Saver” account. 104 From Ms [LZ]’s 50 account three payments were made to “Autoterminal” for the Lexus car: • 8 October 2019 $8,500 105 • 2 December 2019 $6,799 106 • 2 December 2019 $10,000 107 $25,299 [72] As I mentioned, Ms [TW] returned to China in early [2020] to visit her family, and then got stuck there due to the COVID lockdown and border closure. [73] It was on 19 April 2020 that Ms [SD] advised Ms [TW] via a WeChat message that she had cheated on her with another woman who was a colleague. The screenshots of the messages which Ms [SD] attached to her first affidavit as Annexure “A” run to nine pages and are unequivocal. They include the following exchanges: 108 Ms [SD]: I am sorry, but I don’t want to cheat you, I cheated on you, did what I was most ashamed of. Ms [TW]: So you’re breaking up with me? ... Ms [SD]: Let’s break up. I know it’s cruel to tell you at this point. Ms [TW]: And who? Ms [SD]: Colleague. Ms [TW]: You’re getting together? 103 BOD, page 1215. 104 BOD, page 1216 and NOE, page 98, line 1. 105 BOD, page 1245. 106 BOD, page 1243. 107 Ibid. 108 BOD, page 520 to 528. 25 Ms [SD]: not necessarily. Ms [SD]: But I think it’s better to break up with you. ... Ms [TW]: When did this happen? Ms [SD]: These two days. Ms [TW]: Indian colleague? ... Ms [SD]: Yes. Ms [SD]: Also a roommate. Ms [TW]: Okay. ... Ms [TW]: So you’re gonna stay with her for a while? Ms [SD]: Yes. Ms [SD]: But I want to go out for a while before I decide. [74] Ms [TW]’s affidavit evidence was that the relationship “deteriorated” in mid- April 2020 when Ms [SD] told her about the affair, 109 but she said that they remained in contact and continued to have long phone conversations. She deposed that the parties separated on 5 August 2020 when Ms [SD] informed her she had unilaterally withdrawn their joint residence visa application in July. 110 [75] I do not accept that the parties continued to be in a relationship after Ms [SD] informed Ms [TW] of her affair on 19 April. Ms [TW] has not provided evidence of regular or amicable communication, let alone any declarations of love or forgiveness after 19 April and I am influenced in my conclusion by the affidavit evidence of the parties’ mutual friend, [YK], who was not required for cross-examination. 109 BOD, page 373 at [43]. 110 At [44]. 26 [76] Ms [YK] deposed that while communicating with Ms [TW] via WeChat in July 2020, Ms [TW] said that she had split up with Ms [SD] in April. 111 Ms [YK] provided an English translation from a translation service of the WeChat message where Ms [TW] said, “I haven’t told you that I actually broke up with her in April. ” Ms [TW]’s follow-up message, sent the same day, 18 July 2020, said “Might as well tell you today, [you] will find out anyway”. 112 [77] Accordingly, and as noted earlier, I find that the date of separation was 19 April 2020 as stated by Ms [SD], and not 5 August 2020 as argued by Ms [TW]. [78] Ms [TW] was able to return to Christchurch [in 2020]. 113 At that stage she was still completing her [education details deleted]. Ms [TW] acknowledged that she obtained an internship in [2021] 114 and has been working full-time since she graduated in [2021]. [79] Ms [TW] lived at the [address 1] property from [mid-2020] until [mid-2021]. She said that she moved out of [address 1] as soon as she secured full-time employment. 115 However, it was not until 6 October 2021 that her (former) solicitor advised Ms Park by email that Ms [TW] had moved out of the [address 1] property. 116 [80] Ms [TW] has also acknowledged that she received and used rental of $5,760 from tenants in the home between August and December 2020. 117 Ms [TW] said in her oral evidence that three bedrooms were still rented out when she returned to New Zealand [in mid-2020]. 118 Gradually the tenants all moved out and it was just Ms [TW] in the house as from [early 2021]. 119 111 BOD, page 1298 at [8]. 112 BOD, page 1350. 113 NOE, page 110, line 1. 114 NOE, page 109, line 25. 115 NOE, page 110, lines 7 to 9. 116 BOD, page 417. 117 BOD, page 311 at [6(a)]. 118 NOE, page 110, line 21. 119 NOE, page 111, lines 27 to 30. 27 [81] Ms [TW]’s evidence was that she was not able to sign tenancy agreements as the landlord to rent rooms to new tenants because the house was registered in Ms [SD]’s name and Ms [SD] did not agree to Ms [TW] arranging further tenants. 120 [82] Ms [SD] confirmed that [address 1] has been rented again as from 19 April 2022 and has been managed since then by a rental management company, Rempstone. 121 Ms [SD] advised that the house is now rented to one tenant for $970 per week. 122 [83] It is agreed that Ms [SD] paid $7,500 to Ms [TW] on 1 September 2020, being one half of the $15,000 that Ms [SD] had withdrawn from the joint 02 account on 20 July 2020. 123 The respective ANZ joint account balances at the date of separation (19 April 2020) were $6,088. 98 124 and $9,611. 37, 125 so $15,700 in total. That being the case, and as conceded by Ms [TW] she is required to account for the $4,000 that she withdrew from the joint 02 account on 13 July 2020 126 to fund her airfares from China to New Zealand. [84] The most recent developments are that Ms [SD] moved from [town A] to [town B] in April 2022 127 to take up a new job as a [job title deleted]. Ms [SD] was made redundant from that position only a couple of weeks before the hearing, on 17 April 2024, 128 and does not yet have new employment. [85] Ms [SD] purchased a three-bedroom house in [town B] in [2023] for $800,000 with significant assistance from her parents who gifted her half the purchase price. The balance was borrowed from the bank. The house is registered in Ms [SD]’s sole name. 129 120 BOD, page 14, at [73]. 121 NOE, page 203, line 7. 122 NOE, page 119, lines 12 to 26. 123 BOD, page 23. 124 BOD, page 601. 125 BOD, page 643. 126 BOD, page 23. 127 NOE, page 229, line 5. 128 NOE, page 115, line 31. 129 NOE, page 229, line 29, to page 230, line 17. 28 [86] Ms [SD] now has permanent residency in New Zealand. 130 Ms [TW] is not yet a permanent resident but has a residency visa. She advised that she will receive permanent residency in 12 months’ time. 131 [87] Having set out the background in some detail, I turn now to the particular legal issues and decisions on those issues. Is the [address 1] property held on resulting trust? [88] For Mr [HD] and Ms [LZ] it is pleaded that the [address 1] property is held for them (by Ms [SD]) on resulting trust. [89] As noted by the Court of Appeal in Chang v Lee 132 the principle of resulting trust was explained by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in the House of Lords in Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Burrough Council 133 and arises in circumstances where: “ ... A makes a voluntary payment to B or pays (wholly or in part) for the purchase of a property which is vested in either B alone or in the joint names of A and B, there is a presumption that A did not intend to make a gift to B; the money or property is held on trust for A (if he is the sole provider of the money) or in the case of the joint purchase by A and B in shares proportionate to their contribution. It is important to stress that this is only a presumption, which presumption can be easily rebutted either by the counter- presumption of advancement or by direct evidence of A's intention to make an outright transfer ... ” [90] Lord Browne-Wilkinson went on to state that: “ ... resulting trust[s] are traditionally regarded as examples of trusts giving effect to the common intention of the parties. A resulting trust is not imposed by law against the intentions of the trustee (as is a constructive trust) but gives effect to his presumed intention. ..."

KAREN CHRISTIANSEN v JAMES RICHARD JACKSON as the executor of the estate of the late Christopher John Dodd [2024] NZFC 2717 [1 March 2024] NOTE: ANY REPORT OF THIS PROCEEDING MUST COMPLY WITH SS 11B, 11C AND 11D OF THE FAMILY COURT ACT 1980.

The cause of death was an undiagnosed perforated ulcer. He was 55 years old. [2] He left behind a de facto partner, Karen Christiansen, and his only child from a previous marriage, Mitch Dodd. [3] In his last will dated 10 June 2010 Chris left his all estate to Mitch (the last will). [4] Chris and Karen had made a property agreement under s 21 of the Property (Relationships) Act 1976 (the PRA) on 25 May 2017 (the property agreement). The property agreement set out what was to happen if their relationship ended on separation or death. [5] Karen is not challenging the property agreement, but she is making a claim under the Family Protection Act 1955 (the FPA) against Chris’s estate on the grounds that Chris breached his duty to make adequate provision for her in his last will. [6] Although the terms of the property agreement prevent Karen from making a claim against Chris’s estate, it is an established rule of law that parties cannot contract out of the provisions of the FPA. 1 [7] The net value of Chris’s estate is approximately $2 million. 2 Karen’s net worth is approximately $2 million 3 . The issue is whether approximately $2 million is adequate provision for Karen and if not, how much Chris should have left her. Chris and Karen [8] When they met Chris and Karen were in their late 40’s. They were a mature couple who had led full lives. They were both working full time and had built up assets over the years. [9] Chris was an electrician who had worked for the same company for many years. His father, Raymond Dodd, had died and his mother, Doreen Dodd, was living 1 Matthews v Phochai [2020] NZHC 3455 at [38] citing Gardiner v Boag [1923] NZLR 739 (SC); Parish v Parish [1924] NZLR 307 (SC); Re Julso [1975] 2 NZLR 536 (SC); Public Trustee v Dillon ([1940] 874 (SC). 2 See schedule1. It is not possible to be precise about the figures in either schedule 1 or 2 because no formal valuations were obtained for any assets and the schedules had some possible omissions. 3 See schedule 2. independently in her own home at New Lynn. His relationships with his mother and his son Mitch were close. [10] Chris had been married twice before and also been in a long term de facto relationship. His first marriage, to Amanda Dodd, was brief and lasted about 7 months to June 1987. His second marriage, to Annette Dodd, lasted about 10 years to December 1998 and produced Mitch, who was born on [date deleted] 1994. After that Chris was in several relationships, including a de facto relationship which lasted for about six years, before he met Karen in 2012. At the time Chris was living in a property he owned at Titirangi. He also had other assets, such as a Kiwisaver fund and a collection of vehicles which included several classic cars. A mortgage over the Titirangi property had been paid off in full. [11] On 10 June 2010 Chris made his last will appointing his lawyer, James Jackson, as executor and directing that after debts, funeral and testamentary expenses and any duties had been paid the residue of his estate was to be given to Mitch. There was also a charging clause. The last will was simple but effective. 4 [12] Karen was working as an accountant. She had qualified as a chartered accountant in her twenties but never worked at an accountancy firm, preferring to work in businesses and change jobs every three or four years. For about five years from her late twenties to mid-thirties she had worked as a flight attendant and travelled the world. After an unhappy relationship ended in her late twenties, she had not re- partnered nor had any children. [13] Over the years she earned the equivalent of about $120,000 a year in today’s terms and built up assets, starting with a property in Massey which she purchased in her 20s with her brother Adrian. Later on she bought Adrian out. By the time she met Chris she had purchased a second property at Sandringham where she was living. The properties were held via a look through company named Pendragon Estates Limited which Karen had set up in 2006 for tax reasons. Karen also owned a Kiwisaver fund, 4 Although it is described in this decision as a “last will” it is in fact the only will Chris is known to have made. life insurance, bonus bonds and vehicles including a classic car collection of her own. Both Karen and Chris were car enthusiasts. [14] In evidence Karen described herself as an independent person with a wide range of interests and activities, many of which she enjoyed with Chris after they became a couple. She said she was “in vibrant good health” and had been a life long runner. Her family members – father, mother, two brothers and their families – were all close and enjoyed good health too. De facto relationship [15] Karen moved into Chris’ Titirangi property in September 2012. They set up a joint account to which they both contributed but otherwise kept their finances separate. Karen sold the Sandringham property and Pendragon received net sale proceeds of about $255,000. The Massey property was rented with the rent used to cover the mortgage and other outgoings. 5 [16] In March 2015 Chris and Karen signed an agreement to buy a section at Mangawhai for $278,500. The purchase was funded with cash and a mortgage of $180,000. Karen says she contributed cash sums of $71,528 and $28,750. Mitch claims that Chris also contributed, and that the cash contributions were not only from Karen. [17] The Mangawhai property was registered in both names. Both parties contributed to the mortgage payments. Karen says that by the end of 2016 the mortgage had been largely repaid, with lump sum payments of $95,000 on 12 December 2016 and $55,000 on 28 November 2016, both made by her. [18] The parties then purchased a property at Kaiwaka for about $300,000, in the name of Pendragon, using the Massey property as collateral. Karen says that Chris did not contribute. A mortgage was raised to complete the purchase with both parties liable. The Kaiwaka property was rented out with the rent used to pay the mortgage and outgoings. 5 Details of the amount secured by the mortgage when the de facto relationship began are not available, but as at the date of the property agreement the amount secured was $212,000. [19] Karen says that she and Chris intended to: 6 28. ... eventually pool our assets in retirement... to build our dream retirement home on my Mangawhai section complete with a veggie garden and fruit trees, with room for a pony for me and a large shed for Chris... ... 30. ... Because our retirement plans necessitated pooling all our assets our plans included our explicit agreement to leave the bulk of our estates to each other. We did not have any immediate plans to retire but decided to go ahead and make the necessary wills to facilitate the process in the long run rather than waiting until we actually retired. 31. ... We periodically talked over and re-affirmed our commitment to our retirement plans including making wills, before and after the [property] agreement [was made]... [20] Chris initiated the property agreement in 2017. By then the parties had been living together for more than three years. [21] Karen says that although she and Chris “had their share of disagreements from time to time” they “enjoyed a comfortable loving relationship. ” Mitch was less positive and says his father wanted the property agreement made after “trust issues” arose over money matters. It is neither possible nor necessary for any finding about this to be made. [22] Chris contacted his lawyer James Jackson in about April 2017 and Mr Jackson took instructions and prepared a draft. Chris discussed the draft with Karen. Some amendments were made."
